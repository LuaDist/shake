<h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>Many Lua modules and applications use a simple pattern for internal tests. They have a script (usually called
<code>test.lua</code>) that exercises the module API using API calls and <code>assert()</code> calls to verify
the results. It is also common practice in those modules to use <code>print()</code> to output information about the
test progress and to use Lua comments to inform what is being tested to whoever reads the source. Although widespread
this approach may be too crude for those wanting to test more than one module at a time or to have a more detailed view
of the results.</p>

<p>Shake assumes that the tests have been implemented for the above scenartio but offers a transparent test engine
for those wanting the execution of the tests in batch mode or those wanting to get an overview of the various results.
The Shake engine can inform not only the number of tests, failures and errors found in a group of test scripts, but it
can infer information about the test context using the output and comments associated with the <code>assert()</code>
calls.</p>

<p>The main characteristic of Shake is being transparent, which means that the module authors and test writers do not have
to be aware that tests are going to be run with Shake. As long as the tests call <code>assert()</code> Shake can obtain
quite a lot of information from the source and run time execution.</p>

<p>Another common alternative to testing is the one adopted by test frameworks like <a href="http://luaforge.net/projects/lunit/">lunit</a> and
<a href="http://luaforge.net/projects/luaunit/">luaunit</a>, which offer a quite sophisticated API for those test
scripts. For those wanting to use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUnit">xUnit</a> style framework
these two Lua modules are very useful but in this case the test authors have to be aware that the tests are going to be
executed by a xUnit framework.</p>

<p>One of the strong points of the xUnit framework style is being able to report failures in a much more detailed view 
than a simple assertion. In Lua, a call to <code>assert()</code> is basically equivalent to an <code>if</code> that
displays nice error messages (provided in the <code>assert()</code> call). Unfortunately, an assertion just checks if an
expression is true or false and report that as an error in the second case.</p>

<p>This makes the test scripts much simpler, but also means that you have to provide decent error messages for every
assertion and that once one assertion fails, your test stops running. Another disavantage of a simple <code>assert()</code>
call is that it is does not provide much information about what caused the error. For example, in an assertion like:</p>

<pre class="example">
assert(items == 10, "too many items")
</pre>

<p>If the assertion does not fail then you can be certain that you have 10 items, but if it fails then all you can say is that
<code>items</code> is not the number 10. If you want to know what is the current value of <code>items</code>
in that assertion you would have to add it to the error message.</p>

<p>The Shake engine offers an alternative way to obtain that information by preprocessing the test script before it is
executed and constructing a Lua table representation of the test execution. Once the tests are run, we can iterate over
this results table and display a lot more information about the test execution than is usually available. In the above example
Shake would not only be able to inform that the assertion failed, but also the value of <code>items</code> and even that
the asserted expression involved a non terminal called "items" which was supposed to be equal to the number 10.</p>

<p>Since a results table is usually quite long and have a lot of information that may be useful for some users but not others,
Shake offers the separation of a test runner and a test reporter. A test runner is responsible for determining which test scripts
are going to be executed and accumulating the results in the runner results table. A test reporter uses the results table and
displays information about the results in some way. Shake offers two built in runners, one to be used in the command line
and another to be used as a web application. Shake also offers two built in reporters, one that outputs a summary of the
results as a text message and another that displays a much more complete report using HTML tables and CSS to format
the results.</p>

<p>For those wanting more control on the test execution and reporting, the Shake module (the engine itself) can be used
as an standard module and offers an API for test execution and for accessing the results. For more details see the API
<a href="manual.html#reference">reference</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="installation"></a>Installation</h2>

<p>The Shake source distribution contains two components. The first one is a Lua module and command line runner,
the second is a CGILua application runner.</p>

<p>If you are using Unix you can install the command line runner and the Shake module
using the command below (Where the optional <code>PREFIX</code> parameter assumes
<code>/usr/local</code> as default):</p>

<pre class="example">
make <em>PREFIX=prefix_path</em> install
</pre>

<p>After you have the Shake engine installed you can optionally install the CGILua application using a similar command:</p>

<pre class="example">
make <em>KEPLER_PREFIX=prefix_path</em> install_app
</pre>

<p>If you are using Kepler in Windows you would have to copy the source files to your <em>KEPLER_BIN</em>,
<em>KEPLER_LUA</em> (and <em>CGILUA_APPS</em> if you want to use the Shake CGILua application) directories as the example
below shows:</p>

<pre class="example">
<em>Kepler Base</em>
    /apps
    /cgilua
        /shake		-- from /src/apps/shake
    /bin
        shake			-- from /src/bin
        shake.bat		-- from /src/bin
    /lua
        shake.lua		-- from /src/shake
        /shake
            stir.lua		-- from /src/shake
</pre>

<h2><a name="running"></a>Running Shake</h2>

<p>Once installed Shake can be run as a command line command or as a CGILua web application.</p>

<h3>Command line runner</h3>

<p>To run Shake in the command line you just need to go to your test directory and execute

<pre class="example">
shake <em>test_script</em>
</pre>

<p>Shake will then look for the test script (assuming by default that it is called <code>test.lua</code>), execute all
the tests in it and report a summary of the results. If for example you have a module like LuaFileSystem installed and
you go to its <code>/tests</code> directory and run Shake from there, the output would be:</p>

<pre class="example">
~/workspace/luafilesystem/tests$ shake
->  test.lua OK!
_________________

Tests: 27
Failures: 0
Errors: 0
</pre>

<p>On the other hand, if you have a test script like the one below that includes two assertions that are supposed to fail
(lines are numbered):</p>

<pre class="example">
 1	items = 10
 2	-- checks the correct case
 3	assert (items == 10, "this should not fail")
 4
 5	items = 20
 6	-- checks an overflow case
 7	assert (items == 10, "wrong number of items")
 8
 9	print("Verifying the total")
10	items = 10
11	total = 30
12	assert (items == total, "wrong total")
</pre>

<p>Shake would register the failures but would run the whole test script, reporting at the end:</p>

<pre class="example">
:~/workspace$ shake
----------------    test.lua failed!   ----------------

-- checks an overflow case
   #7 assert (items == 10, "wrong number of items")
   items -> 20

Verifying the total
   #12 assert (items == total, "wrong total")
   items -> 10
   total -> 30
_________________

Tests: 3
Failures: 2
Errors: 0

</pre>

<p>Note how much more informative this is when compared to the default output of running the test script with Lua:</p>

<pre class="example">
:~/workspace$ lua5.1 test.lua
lua5.1: test.lua:7: wrong number of items
stack traceback:
        [C]: in function 'assert'
        test.lua:7: in main chunk
        [C]: ?
</pre>

<h3>CGILua application runner</h3>

<p>If you have installed the Shake CGILua application in your <code>CGILUA_APPS</code> directory, Shake assumes
that the tests to be run will be in the <code>SHAKE_TESTS</code> directory.  If you don't define <code>SHAKE_TESTS</code>
in your CGILua configuration file, Shake assumes the default of <code>KEPLER_CONF.."/tests"</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>SHAKE_TESTS</code> directory should contain one directory for each module that you want to test.
When you access the URL

<pre class="example">
/app.lua/shake
</pre>

<p>Shake will look into those directories for a <code>test.lua</code>
file and execute it if present. After all the test scripts are executed Shake will report a summary of the results for all the tests
executed.<p>

<p>This report is an HTML table that also offers a link to a more detailed view to the results of a single module test run.
Once you click on that link Shake will show the full results of the test execution, including every assertion involved, even
the succesfull ones</p>

<h2><a name="reference"></a>Reference</h2>

<p>For those interested in more control over the runner and the report, Shake offers the following functions:</p>

<dl class="reference">
    <dt><strong><code>runner()</code></strong></dt>
    <dd>
    Returns a Shake runner that offers the functions <code>test(filename)</code> and <code>summary()</code>
    </dd>
</dl>
